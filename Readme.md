#Lab O Python Intro

In this lab, we were tasked to get a basic understanding of python in order to create a program that would: 
* Take in a .txt file filled with strings
* Find the amount of times each string was used in that file
* write all that information to a new .txt file
* Make sure that all information was alphabetically organized 

The program that achieved all these requirements is named `wordCount.py`. Which used a dictionary to gather all the information from the passed text file,
adds new words into the dictionary, and if the word already exists then it will increment the number coenciding that key. Next the dictionary is sorted and is has all it's keys and coenciding numbers to that key written to a file named `myOutput.txt`.
